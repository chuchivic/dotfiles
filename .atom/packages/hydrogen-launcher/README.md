# :rocket: Hydrogen Launcher

With Hydrogen Launcher you can open a terminal at the current working directory with a simple command.

It is tested on linux, macOS and windows. You also can easily configure it to use your favorite terminal application.

## Usage

If you are using [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/) to work with jupyter kernels you can launch a [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) or [ipython](https://ipython.org/) console connected to your running kernel.
